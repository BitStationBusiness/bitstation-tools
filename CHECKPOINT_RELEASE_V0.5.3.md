# CHECKPOINT: Release v0.5.3 (Recovery)

**Date**: 2026-02-06
**Context**: Recovery from failed release v0.5.2/v0.5.3 due to git lock file issues.

## State of the Project
- **Current Version**: v0.5.3 (z-image-turbo), v0.1.4 (add)
- **Git Status**: Clean. `v0.5.3` tag points to the commit with `version: 0.5.3` in `tool.json`.
- **Known Issues**: `git add .` was hanging due to a persistent lock on `.git/index.lock`, likely caused by an external process/editor.

## Actions Taken
1. Killed stuck `git.exe` processes.
2. Removed `.git/index.lock`.
3. Created `release_v0.5.3.ps1` to automate the fix:
   - Verified `tool.json` version.
   - Committed pending changes (version bump).
   - Force-updated `v0.5.3` tag to point to the new commit.
   - Pushed tag to trigger GitHub Actions.

## Instructions for Next AI
- Always check for `.git/index.lock` if git commands hang.
- Use `release_*.ps1` scripts for releases to ensure sequential steps (clean, commit, tag, push).
- `dist/` is generated by GitHub Actions, but can be generated locally with `python build/pack_tools.py` for verification.
